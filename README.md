# ML_Model-for-Medical-Image-Segmentation
Developed a method that can automatically detect the bone area from a knee MRI image by training a model to segment the tibia bone. - Used a customized BML software developed by Tufts Medical Center to label the tibia bone for each MRI image slice and generate data for training the model and generate binary masks from the labeled images using MATLAB. - Used Python code to construct, train, and test the U-net model. - Improved the model performance to 95% by using different combination for train and validation set, adjusting the batch size and the epochs. - Using Data augmentation, pre-trained encoders and post processing the masks to further improve the performance.
